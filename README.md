# Space Pop!

## Inspired by the pop art movement of the mid-century, here are a collection of posters for some of the most import instruments we use to study the cosmos. For now, I've focused on instruments/missions that are exoplanet-related but I will continue to add more encompassing broader topics in astronomy.

## These are free for public use! All I ask is for proper credit to be given by using the provided informational backside of each poster or something comparable. Please do not attempt to monetize these pieces.

### Notes on Names Used:
### The names I used in these posters come from what I believe to be the "origin" paper for each instrument/mission and I provide the source for each below. For the sake of design, choices were made as to what names to include. Exclusion of an author's name is not meant to discredit the valuable work they contributed. 

### - TESS: Ricker et al. 2015 (2015JATIS...1a4003R). This article had too many names to fit onto a single poster. The first 10 were used.
### - Kepler: Borucki et al. 2008 (2008IAUS..249...17B). Jorgen Christensen-Dalsgaard appears earlier in the authorlist but I chose to have it on its own due to the length of the name.
### - Keck/HIRES: Vogt et al. 1994 (1994SPIE.2198..362V). I omitted authors for whom I could not confidently determine their full first name...if you know then please ping me!
